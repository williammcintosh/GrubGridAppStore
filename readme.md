# Grub Grid Project
#### Bennett Desmond and Will McIntosh

## Intro
The goal of this project is to use the two machine learning models of Matrix Factorization and Collaborative Filtering to recommend recipes.

## Steps

1. The user will provide two of their favorite ingredients, and we will provide a list of five highly rated recipes that include those ingredients.
2. The user will then "swipe right" or "left" depending on if they like or dislike the five recipes (or plan to cook them).
3. Depending on the user's input we will use Cosine Similarity Comparison for all users in the Matrix Facorization to predict the next recipes for them.
4. This will be on a mobile iOS app (hopefully).
